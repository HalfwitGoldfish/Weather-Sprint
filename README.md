**Peer Review**: Bronel Lazar

review Notes: The application looks good! I can favorite and unfavorite, the search works, forecast works I get the weather data and the icons work properly. Only thing is that when you unfavorite a city from the favorites list it doesn't unhiglight the star of the location on the actual page itself
